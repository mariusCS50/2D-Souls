### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Collision Detection**:
   Implementing accurate and efficient collision detection was challenging, particularly for projectiles and enemy interactions. The solution involved using precise hitboxes and a simplified collision model to maintain performance.

2. **Synchronizing Animations and Events**:
   Early issues with animations being out of sync with gameplay events were addressed by implementing an event-driven system that coordinated animations and logic seamlessly.

3. **Balancing Gameplay**:
   Finding the right difficulty balance was a significant challenge. The team tested various configurations for enemy behavior, boss mechanics, and player abilities to ensure the game remained challenging but fair.
